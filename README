Data download

Use sra-toolkits; alternatively we can download from ENA, but seems easier to select desired samples to download with SRA Run Selector


Obtain list of samples (SRRs) and metadata info from the SRA Run Selector ->
Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?go=home and type the study accession number (e.g. GSE81266) into the search field.
If not all conditions are of interest, select Facets/disease state/etc. accordingly 
Make a folder with the name of the study accession on the server
cd /home/projects/misc/anigen/IBD_public_data/human/ 
mkdir -p GSE81266 
Download SRR_Acc_List.txt and SRA_runtable.txt to the folder (eventually save locally and copy to the server using scp). 

Make sure you are on rna02 before starting the download and/or fastQC scripts.
	ssh rna02
Go to the folder you created for the study
	cd /home/projects/misc/anigen/IBD_public_data/human/GSE81266  
Download files:
	nohup sh /home/projects/cpr/anigen/data/IBD_public_data/scripts/download.sh &
Wait until the download is finished and then run FastQC:
nohup sh /home/projects/cpr/anigen/data/IBD_public_data/scripts/run_fastqc.sh &
FastQC files will be placed in results/fastqc in the folder of the study
	
See here what nohup command does https://www.computerhope.com/unix/unohup.htm
(After writing the command terminated in "&" press enter and you can continue working in the terminal while the script runs in the background)

Adapter trimming:
	n=`wc -l SRR_Acc_List.txt | awk '{print $1}'` 
qsub -v WD=$(pwd) -t 1-$n    /home/projects/cpr/anigen/data/IBD_public_data/scripts/run_flexbar_batch.sh

Create file config.txt

Read collapsing: 
Adapt script
/home/projects/cpr/anigen/data/IBD_public_data/scripts/run_collapser_batch.sh

Mapping with Bowtie:
Adapt script
/home/projects/cpr/anigen/data/IBD_public_data/scripts/run_bowtie_batch.sh
